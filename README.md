🎨 AI Virtual Painter ✋💡

Overview 🌟

AI Virtual Painter is a hand-gesture-based digital painting tool that enables users to draw in the air without physical contact. It leverages MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect and track hand movements in real-time, simulating a virtual brush for seamless interaction. 🎨✨

Features 🚀

🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition: Uses computer vision techniques to detect and track hand movements.

🎥 Real-Time Drawing: Enables users to paint virtually without touching a surface.

🖌️ Intuitive UI: Designed for smooth and accessible user interaction.

⚡ Optimized Gesture Tracking: Ensures precise and fluid drawing experiences.

Technologies Used 🛠️

🖥️ MediaPipe – For hand tracking and gesture recognition.

📷 OpenCV – For computer vision and image processing.

🐍 Python – Core programming language for implementation.



Usage 🎨

🖐️ Move your hand in front of the camera to start drawing.

🌈 Use different hand gestures to change colors, erase, or adjust the brush size.

✊ Close your hand to stop drawing.
